<h2>The Yada Yada Story</h2>
    <p>Yada Yada was founded in 2019 by the same team that previously ran "Don't Blame Us".
    Our name, Yada Yada, was inspired by the fact that we only program in Java, which is a
        notoriously verbose language. Remember, quality takes time, and while we might not
        deliver quality, we always take our time!</p>
